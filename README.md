<p align="center">Low-Key Anime, High-Key Fashion</p>

"TheDrip" is a novel e-commerce platform targeting the young, fashion-forward audience, a demographic that has grown up with and appreciates anime culture. By focusing on subtle, "low-key" anime-inspired streetwear, "TheDrip" bridges the gap between mainstream fashion and niche anime merchandise.
